# Work-day-schedule

1. html set up is a basic table. This way, I found, made it easier for me to separate the rows and columns. Then I added classes to the rows and a textarea tag for the user input. The classes made it easier to work with the jquery manipulation. 

2. Made minor changes to the css since most of it was already pre-loaded.

3. Began doing pseudo code for the variables first and decided that a for loop would suit best because I could simply compare time slots to teh moment.js api and get the color of the row correct based on the time of day (PST). I used an array and a parseInt on the rows to be able to compare numbers and not strings, as the first attempted code did and did not render the results desired.
